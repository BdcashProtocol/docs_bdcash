In case you have already created a portfolio or are already using **Wallet App**, you can access the **Wallet Web** portfolio in several ways:
- By selecting a .sid file generated by **Wallet App** or via **IDBDCash**.
- Using the **IDBDCash** extension directly through your web browser.

**Important:** make a backup and remember that you are ** ONLY ** responsible for this associated .sid file and password. Keep it safe.
Losing the file and / or password will make it impossible for anyone to access the wallet and the funds / data contained in it!
