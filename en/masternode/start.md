# Masternode Setup

To activate one or more BdcashProtocol  masternodes you will need the [official desktop wallet](../wallet/fullnode.md) and the collateral required of **2500 BDECO** for each masternode.

If you want to proceed for a manual installation, you must keep in mind that the process requires technical skills, a VPS server with a dedicated IP address and time for installation.


Alternatively, you can use masternode hosting services [Hostings](../masternode-setup/hosting-service.md).
